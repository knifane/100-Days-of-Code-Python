# INSTRUCTIONS: I was reading this article by Tim Urban - Your Life in Weeks and realised just how little time we actually have.

## https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html

## Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old.

## It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:

## You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.

## Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.

# Warning your output should match the Example Output format exactly, even the positions of the commas and full stops.

# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇
age = input("What is your current age? ")
# 🚨 Don't change the code above 👆

#Write your code below this line 👇

num = 90 - int(age)

days = num * 365
weeks = num * 52
months = num * 12

print('You have', str(days),'days,', str(weeks), 'weeks, and', str(months), 'months left.')
