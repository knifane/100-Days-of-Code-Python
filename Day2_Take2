# data types = string, integer, float, boolean

# use [ ] for the character index, starting at 0 and up to character range: subscripting method
# print("hello"[0]) = h
# its possible to use negative indeces, it starts from the right instead of left like positive indeces
# print("hello"[-1]) = o

# note: anything within "" is treated as a string, even "123"
# print("123" + "345") = concatenation 

# integer = whole numbers
# print(123+345) = 468

# float = numbers with decimal points, a "floating point number"

# boolean = only has 2 possible values: True or False (first letter must be capitalized and with no "")

# use type() to get the data type and use print to get the output: type checking
# print(type("Hello")) = string 
# print (type(True)) = bool

# typecasting : changing the type of data of something
# change_to_number = int("123")
# print (type("123")) - sanity check
# print(type(change_to_number))
# but int("abc") won't work because its not a valid number
# int()
# float()
# str()
# bool()

# mathematical operations in Python
# addition : print (123 + 456) 
# subtraction : print (7-3)
# multipy : print (3 * 3) 
# divide : print (6 / 3) - this will always result in a floating number = 2.0 : implict typecasting
# alternative divide : print (6//3) - this will result in an integer = 2.0 : but be careful bc in case of a decimal, this will only output the first integer
# exponent : print (2**2) 
# python will follow PEMDAS generally 
# but if all on the same line, * OR / will be treated same and priority will be given to whichever comes first from left to right
# same goes for + OR -
# print (3 * 3 + 3 / 3 - 3) = 7.0
# print (3 * 3 + 3 // 3 - 3)= 7

# "floor a number" = removing all the numbers after the decimal point in (BUT NOT ROUNDED)
# to round to nearest whole number, use round() function. to round to a specific decimal point, use round (#, decimal)
# print (round(4/3)) = 1
# print (round(4/3,2)) = 1.33

# assignment operator : allows to a value based on its previous value
# +=
# score = 0
# score += 1
# print (score) = 1
# -=
# *=
# /=

# f-strings : allows to print different data types, use f in front of the string and use {} inside the string
# print ("Your score is " + str(score)) is same as
# print (f"Your score is = {score}") = Your score is = 1

# another example of f-string
# score = 0
# height = 1.8
# is_winning = True
# print (f"Your score is = {score}, Your height is {height}, Your team is winning is {is_winning}") = Your score is = 0, Your height is 1.8, Your team is winning is True
