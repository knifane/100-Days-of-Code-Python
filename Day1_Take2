# Learning to print

# python input function - allows user interaction before closing
#input("What is your name? ") #I added the space because the cursor goes right after the question mark
# we can nest the functions. inner nest goes first.
#print ("Hello " + input("What is your name? "))

# hotkeys to comment out a line: ctrl+\ for windows and ctrl+/ for mac

# python variables
#name = input("What is your name? ")
# variable "name" will store the user input
#print (name)
# variable can be any data, even just a string, and can be changed later in the code

# exercise: count how many letters are in a name
# use len() function
#print (len("hello"))
# name = input("What is your name? ")
# print("Hello, " + name + ". Did you know your name has " + str(len(name)) + " letters in your name?")
# ^ I ran into concatenate error, len() does not output a string so I had to use the string function to fix that.
# instructor's simplified code: print(len(input("What is your name? ")))

# variable name cannot have spaces, use _ instead. also cannot have variable name start with a number.

# BAND NAME GENERATOR project: Start with "Welcome to the Band Name Generator." Next time asks "What is the name of the city you grew up in?" User input next line. Following line: "What is your pet's name?". Next line is user input. Final name starts with "Your band name is" and combines the city and pet name.
print ("Welcome to the Band Name Generator.")
