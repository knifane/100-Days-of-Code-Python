# PROJECT: Tip Calculator 

# INSTRUCTIONS: Calculate the tip per person based on total bill, percentage tip, and how many people are splitting bill. Should look like below: 
## Welcome to the tip calculator.
## What was the total bill? $124.56
## What percentage tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15? 12
## How many people to split the bill? 7
##Each person should pay: $19.93

## WARNING: Even though the final amount might have more numbers after the decimal point, only give 2 decimal places.

print('Welcome to the Tip Calculator.')
total= input('What was the total bill? $')
percent = input('What percentage tip would you like to give? 10, 12, or 15? ')
people = input('How many people to split the bill? ')

tip = int(percent)/100
tip += 1

perPerson = round(int(total) * tip / int(people), 2)

print(f'Each person should pay ${perPerson}')
