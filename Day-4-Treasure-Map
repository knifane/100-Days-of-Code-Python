# INSTRUCTIONS: You are going to write a program that will mark a spot with an X.

# In the starting code, you will find a variable called map.

# This map contains a nested list. When map is printed this is what the nested list looks like:

# ['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️'],['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️'],['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']

# In the starting code, we have used new lines (\n) to format the three rows into a square, like this:

# ['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']

# ['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']

# ['⬜️', '⬜️', '⬜️']

# This is to try and simulate the coordinates on a real map.
# our job is to write a program that allows you to mark a square on the map using a two-digit system. 
# The first digit is the vertical column number and the second digit is the horizontal row number. 
# First, your program must take the user input and convert it to a usable format.

# Next, you need to use it to update your nested list with an "x".

# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇
row1 = ["⬜️","⬜️","⬜️"]
row2 = ["⬜️","⬜️","⬜️"]
row3 = ["⬜️","⬜️","⬜️"]
map = [row1, row2, row3]
print(f"{row1}\n{row2}\n{row3}")
position = input("Where do you want to put the treasure? ")
# 🚨 Don't change the code above 👆

#Write your code below this row 👇

coordinates = [int(num) for num in position]
# print(coordinates)
y = coordinates[0]-1
# print(y)
x = coordinates[1]-1
# print(x)
map[x][y] = "x"


#Write your code above this row 👆

# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇
print(f"{row1}\n{row2}\n{row3}")
